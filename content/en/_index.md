**🔓 Share Web Content Freely**

CENO Browser allows people to share web content with each other, peer-to-peer, even when the Internet is down or blocked.

**🌐 Join the Network Instantly**

You don't need to know a friendly proxy server in an uncensored zone in order to bypass local filtering.  CENO is built in expectation of aggressive Internet filtering and the establishment of [national intranets][] to fence off nations from the Web.

**🔐 Reliable, Secure Browsing**

CENO is based on [Firefox for Android][] (a.k.a. Mozilla Fennec), extended to make use of the innovative [Ouinet library][], which allows web content to be served with the help of an entire network of cooperating nodes using peer-to-peer routing and distributed caching of responses.

[Ouinet library]: https://github.com/equalitie/ouinet/

**👐  Free and open source.**

 CENO Browser is powered by Ouinet, an open source library enabling third party  developers to incorporate the CENO network into their apps for peer-to-peer  connectivity.
