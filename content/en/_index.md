CENO (short for [Censorship.no!][]) is a mobile Web browser using a novel approach to circumvent Internet censorship infrastructure, allowing users living in a censored zone to share retrieved content with each other, peer to peer.

[Censorship.no!]: https://censorship.no/

CENO users do not need to know a friendly proxy server in an uncensored zone in order to bypass local filtering â€” setting CENO apart from most other circumvention initiatives.  CENO is built in expectation of aggressive Internet filtering and the establishment of [national intranets][] to fence off nations from the Web.

CENO is based on [Firefox for Android][] (a.k.a. Mozilla Fennec), extended to make use of the innovative [Ouinet library][], which allows web content to be served with the help of an entire network of cooperating nodes using peer-to-peer routing and distributed caching of responses.
